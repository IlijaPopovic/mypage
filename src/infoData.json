    "shortText": "My educational journey began at high school in Subotica, where I developed a strong technical foundation. I furthered my skills at a bootcamp before pursuing studies at a college in Subotica. Seeking an international perspective, I then attended an university in Linz, Austria. Each step has shaped my expertise and worldview, guiding me towards my aspirations.",
    "text": "My journey into the captivating realm of software development commenced at Technical School 'Ivan Sarić' in Subotica, a pivotal moment where I was first introduced to the intricacies of programming and software creation. It was here that I laid the groundwork, acquiring essential knowledge and skills that would form the cornerstone of my career. Upon completing high school in 2018, I made the decision to relocate to Belgrade, enticed by a promising opportunity at a company that recognized my potential. Concurrently, I seized the chance to further hone my expertise by enrolling in a year-long IT academy program. I specialized in web development, delving deep into the intricacies of front-end and back-end technologies. The program not only expanded my technical proficiency but also instilled in me a passion for crafting innovative solutions through software development, which I eagerly applied to my work. However, the year 2020 brought unforeseen challenges with the onset of the global pandemic. Forced to adapt, I made the decision to relocate back to Subotica, transitioning seamlessly into remote work. With newfound flexibility and time at my disposal, I seized the opportunity to further enrich my academic journey by enrolling in the Higher Technical School of Professional Studies in Subotica. Here, I delved into advanced topics in computer science, refining my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and software architecture. In early 2022, my dedication and academic prowess culminated in a remarkable opportunity - participation in the prestigious Central European Exchange program at Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria. Embarking on this transformative journey, I spent six months immersed in a rich academic environment, surrounded by brilliant minds and cutting-edge research. The experience broadened my horizons, exposing me to diverse perspectives and innovative approaches in software development. From collaborative projects to intensive coursework, every moment was a learning opportunity, shaping me into a more adept and well-rounded professional. Upon my return to Subotica, I was honored with the offer to extend my stay in Linz for another semester, a testament to my academic achievements and contributions. Embracing this continuation of my international adventure, I delved deeper into specialized areas of computer science, engaging in rigorous research and academic discourse. The culmination of my studies in Linz marked a significant milestone in my academic journey, paving the way for my return to Subotica to complete remaining exams and defend my thesis.
